Hi,
Broken Link Hijacking (BLH) exists whenever a target links to an expired domain or page.
This type of bug seems to be unharmful but in fact it is not.

Looking at the endpoint page you can see that it's possible to hijack the below link:

As you can see below the domain is for sale:

#Impact:
An attacker can buy the domain and use it to distribuite malware, produce spam campains or for some Black SEO hack in any case you will suffer from a reputation damage.
Tabnabbing is also possible due to the lack of "rel=noopener" tag.
Any user will fall into this because they trust the main domain.
Also, sometimes, the hackers just want to attack the end users, broken links could be a very interesting assist for __waterholing attacks__.

#Attack Scenario:

1. The attacker buy DOMAIN
2. Then he set up a redirect from DOMAIN to TARGET (using a typosquatting domain... few example below)
3. In the fake DOMAIN URL the attacker replicate a sensible page (eg. a login page)
4.All the users that can't spot the difference in the address bar will get fooled

Below few typos domains available:

I suggest you to set up a links checker script that runs periodically in order to avoid the aforementioned vulnerability.


Regards
